# Coursework Index (OSU) — through June 2024

This repository indexes my OSU course assignments hosted in OSU GitHub organizations. Some links may be private to OSU org members. 

## Resume-ready summary
- Built full-stack and client-side projects across web (HTML/CSS/JS), mobile (Android/Kotlin), and cloud (Node/Express, Terraform), with a focus on correctness, readability, and deployment.
- Implemented RESTful APIs, basic auth flows, and data validation; wrote small tests/benchmarks to verify correctness and performance.
- Developed Android apps using modern patterns (activities/fragments, RecyclerView, view binding), with simple networking and persistence.
- Practiced Infra-as-Code with Terraform to provision and document reproducible environments.
- Communicated outcomes clearly via READMEs, demos, and lightweight deployment notes.

- If you want public visibility for recruiters:
  - Mirror a few standout assignments into this repo (sanitized, with READMEs explaining requirements, your approach, and results).
  - Or add them as submodules; note that private submodules won’t render for the public.
