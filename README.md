# Coursework Index (OSU) — through June 2024

This repository indexes my OSU course assignments hosted in OSU GitHub organizations. Some links may be private to OSU org members. For public viewing, I can mirror selected work into this repo with summaries and sanitized snapshots.

## Resume-ready summary
- Built projects across web (HTML/CSS/JS), backend APIs (Node/Express), mobile (Android/Kotlin), and cloud/IaC (Terraform), emphasizing correctness, readability, and deployment.
- Implemented REST endpoints, auth flows, and input validation; added tests/benchmarks to verify correctness and performance.
- Developed Android apps using activities/fragments, RecyclerView, view binding, and lifecycle-aware patterns with basic networking/persistence.
- Practiced infrastructure-as-code with Terraform to provision reproducible environments and document deploy workflows.
- Communicated outcomes via clear READMEs, demos, and iteration notes; collaborated through code reviews and issue tracking.

## Resume bullets (tailor with specifics)
- Designed and shipped X using Y, improving Z (e.g., runtime, memory, UX) by N% via A optimization and B data structure.
- Implemented REST API for N resources with validation and auth, reducing average response time by M% and error rates by P%.
- Built an Android feature (RecyclerView + ViewModel) enabling offline-first lists; reduced crash rate by Q% and improved retention.
- Provisioned cloud resources with Terraform modules and remote state; cut environment setup time from H hours to T minutes.
- Increased unit test coverage from C1% to C2% and instituted CI checks to prevent regressions.
